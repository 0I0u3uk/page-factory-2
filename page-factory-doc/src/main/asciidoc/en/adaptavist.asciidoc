== Adaptavist (Jira Test Manager)
TAG allows to use Adaptavist. You need to configure your project and set relations between tests ni Jira and autotests in project.

First you should create a test base in `Jira` - cases with relations to issues.

Assume that we have in issue `TAG-945` in `TAG` project, with test cases linked to it.

Create a test in `Traceability` section:

Set up name and other required params, save:

image:../images/save.png[]

An info popup with test case `id` should be shown. In our case `TAG-T4`:

image:../images/saved.png[]

You can see test case linked to the issue:

image:../images/saved-issue.png[]

A list with test cases can be checked as follows:

{counter:ab}. Follow to `Tests` section:

image:../images/tests.png[]

{counter:ab}. Find a test case by `id`:

More information about test model structure you can find in official doc https://support.smartbear.com/zephyr-scale-cloud/docs/[Adaptavist^, role="ext-link"]
